Changes for CaC for AAP 2.5:

- Need to use the modified infra.aap_utilities collection with the updated ocp role
- controller_hostname needs to have https:// on the front (for the ansible.eda collection - ansible.controller doesn't care)
- controller_organizations needs to be changed to aap_organizations
- The default DEs/EEs/credentials (eg. ah_published) do not get created by default
- EDA objects (projects, DEs, activations etc) need organization: values
- In EDA, instead of an awx_token you now need to specify an eda credential:
      eda_credentials:
        - name: aap_access
          description: aap_access
          credential_type: "Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform"
          organization: midrange
          inputs:
            host: "{{ controller_hostname }}"
            username: "{{ controller_username }}"
            password: "{{ controller_password }}"
- And the EDA credential must be specified in the activation:
      eda_rulebook_activations:
        - name: augment-incident
          description: ServiceNow Incident Augmentation Demo
          project: augment-incident-project
          rulebook: snow_incident_listener.yml
          decision_environment: augment-incident-de
          eda_credentials:
            - "aap_access"
          organization: midrange
- EDA user tokens no longer work
- eda_host / eda_password are no longer generated by infra.aap_utilities
